No Column Widths
================

This is a very simple Ghrome extension that removes `width` attributes
from `<td>`s & `<th>`s. Some websites that I must use at work use this
attribute, and it makes working with them very difficult.

It's possible that some websites use `width` attributes well. So it'd be
nice if this extension allowed making a whitelist of allowed sites, but
until I need it I don't care to develop it.
